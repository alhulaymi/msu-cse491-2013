Homework #1
===========

(Note, this homework is not yet complete; I may add to it. --titus the first)

Due January 24th at 11:59pm.

0. Fork my cse491-numberz repository into your own github account, and clone
   it into your account.  Base the homework off of this.

1. Look at my implementation of Eratosthenes' Sieve, sieve-fn.py, and
   implement this in module, iterator, and generator form (as you saw
   above with series_mod, series_iter, and series_gen, etc.).  Add,
   commit, and push back to your github repository.

   Use the same naming conventions for your implementation as we did for
   'series' and 'fib' so we know where to look for your solutions.

   Hint: if it is not viewable through the github Web interface, you did
   not successfully add/commit/push!

   Warning: code with syntax errors => 0 points.

2. Write at least six tests (three each) for your iterator and
   generator implementations of the Sieve, and then add/commit/push
   them to your github repo.  These should be scripts named 'test1.py'
   etc. that are standalone, can be executed by the command line, and
   test something about your implementation in 'sieve.py'.  The tests
   *can* be similar (or even the same) for iterator and generators,
   but should be checked into each directory.

3. Hand in your homework by filling in this form:

   You can fill it in at any time, but I can't grade your homework if I don't
   have this information :)
